# Vulkan Learning Repository Notes
Welcome to the notes directory of the Vulkan Learning Repository!

This directory contains various notes and documentation related to the Vulkan API. The notes are organized into subdirectories based on topics and examples. Each note is intended to provide insights, explanations, and additional information about Vulkan concepts, features, and best practices.

The notes will be written by me personally, and they will be updated as I learn more about Vulkan and its features. The goal is to create a comprehensive backlog of my learning journey with Vulkan, which can be useful for both myself and others who are interested in learning Vulkan.
