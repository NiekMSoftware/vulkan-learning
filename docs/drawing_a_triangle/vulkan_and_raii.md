# Vulkan & RAII Principles
> Written by Niek Melet - 8/22/2025

Vulkan is a low-level graphics API that provides fine-grained control over GPU resources and operations.

However, this level of control comes with increased complexity, particularly in resource management. 
Unlike higher-level APIs, Vulkan requires developers to manually manage the lifecycle of resources such as buffers, images, and command pools.

To effectively manage resources in Vulkan, developers often employ RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) principles. 
RAII is a programming idiom that ties the lifecycle of resources to the lifetime of objects. 
In C++, this is typically achieved through constructors and destructors.

By encapsulating Vulkan resources within C++ classes, developers can ensure that resources are properly allocated and deallocated,
reducing the risk of memory leaks and other resource management issues.

This is **however**, not being showcased within the tutorials, as the focus is on simplicity and clarity for educational purposes.
For production code, it is highly recommended to implement RAII principles to manage Vulkan resources effectively.

Here are some key RAII principles to consider when working with Vulkan:
1. **Encapsulation**: Wrap Vulkan resources in C++ classes. For example, create a `Buffer` class that manages a Vulkan buffer's creation and destruction.
2. **Constructor/Destructor**: Use constructors to allocate resources and destructors to free them. This ensures that resources are released when the object goes out of scope.
3. **Copy/Move Semantics**: Implement copy and move constructors and assignment operators to manage resource ownership correctly. This prevents double-free errors and ensures that resources are transferred safely.
4. **Smart Pointers**: Consider using smart pointers (e.g., `std::unique_ptr`, `std::shared_ptr`) to manage resource lifetimes automatically, especially for complex resource hierarchies.
5. **Error Handling**: Ensure that resource allocation failures are handled gracefully, and resources are cleaned up appropriately in case of errors.
6. **Resource Pools**: Use resource pools to manage multiple instances of similar resources efficiently, reducing allocation overhead.

By adhering to these RAII principles, developers can create robust and maintainable Vulkan applications that effectively manage GPU resources while minimizing the risk of memory leaks and other resource-related issues.

I myself will be implementing RAII principles later in the future, as of right now, the focus is on learning the basics of Vulkan and graphics programming.
